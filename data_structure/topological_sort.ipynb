    "#### Topological sort\n",
    "\n",
    "Topological sorting is a technique used to organize a collection of items or tasks based on their dependencies. Imagine there is a list of tasks to complete, but some tasks can only be done after others are finished. There are many such tasks that depend on each other, or there’s a specific sequence of actions that must be followed. For example, when baking a cake, there are several steps one needs to follow, and some steps depend on others. We can’t frost the cake until it’s baked, and we can’t bake it until we’ve mixed the batter. To ensure that we don’t frost the cake before baking it or mix the batter after preheating the oven, we need to sort the steps based on their dependencies. This is where topological sorting helps us. It figures out the correct sequence of steps to bake the cake efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "The topological sort pattern is used to find valid orderings of elements that have dependencies on or priority over each other. These elements can be represented as the nodes of a graph, so in technical terms, topological sort is a way of ordering the nodes of a directed graph such that for every directed edge \n",
    "[a,b]\n",
    " from node \n",
    "a\n",
    " to node \n",
    "b\n",
    ", \n",
    "a\n",
    " comes before \n",
    "b\n",
    " in the ordering.\n",
    "\n",
    " If we write a recipe for baking a cake, then the list of tasks goes like first mix the batter, then bake the cake, and finally, frost it. These tasks can also be organized in a graph, where each task is a node, and the dependencies between tasks are represented by directed edges.\n",
    "\n",
    " However, if we mistakenly add an additional step in our recipe that contradicts any of the existing steps, it introduces a cycle in our graph. For example, if the recipe goes like mix the batter, frost the cake, bake the cake, and frost the cake, we can’t frost a cake that hasn’t been baked and can’t bake a cake that’s already frosted. Similarly, in a graph with cycles, we can’t establish a clear order of tasks, making topological sorting impossible. Therefore, topological sorting is only applicable to directed acyclic graphs (DAGs), where tasks are organized in a logical sequence without any contradictions or cycles.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    " Topological sorting is crucial for converting a partial ordering to a complete ordering, especially when certain tasks have defined dependencies while others do not. For instance, consider a research project involving five tasks, labeled as \n",
    "A\n",
    ", \n",
    "B\n",
    ", \n",
    "C\n",
    ", \n",
    "D\n",
    ", and \n",
    "E\n",
    ". Some tasks depend on others: Task \n",
    "A\n",
    " must be completed before Task \n",
    "B\n",
    " and Task \n",
    "C\n",
    ", Task \n",
    "B\n",
    " must be finished before the Task \n",
    "D\n",
    ", and Task \n",
    "C\n",
    " must be done before Task \n",
    "E\n",
    ". However, when it comes to performing Tasks \n",
    "B\n",
    " and \n",
    "C\n",
    ", it’s unclear which one should be done first. This is where topological sorting comes in. It helps us convert this partial ordering of tasks into a complete ordering, providing clarity on the sequence of tasks to ensure efficient execution. There can be multiple possible valid ordering of the elements. For example, based on the given dependencies in our example, some valid orderings of the tasks could be:\n",
